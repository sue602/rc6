[ intro

If you're searching for a highly optimized implementation of RC6, the 
source code included here probably isn't suitable. It was written to 
reduce space which isn't normally what people want for encryption. 

AFAIK, this algorithm is patented and requires a license for commercial 
purposes.

I should acknowledge that I found work by Drizz[1] to be very helpful 
here and I was influenced by his key setup routine.

The code is public domain, feel free to do with as you wish.
